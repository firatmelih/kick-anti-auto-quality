## What This Extension Does

**The Problem**: Kick.com has an annoying feature where your stream quality preference resets to "Auto" every time you close your browser. This means you have to manually select your preferred quality (720p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p) every single time you visit the site. Your quality selection doesn't persist between browser sessions.

**The Solution**: This extension automatically sets your chosen stream quality and prevents Kick from defaulting back to "Auto". Set it once and forget about it! No more manual quality selection every time you visit Kick.

### Key Features

- **Eliminates "Auto" Quality**: Your selected quality stays persistent across browser sessions
- **One-Time Setup**: Choose your preferred quality once and it's automatically applied
- **Smart Caching**: Remembers your quality preference even after browser restarts
- **Instant Application**: Quality is applied immediately when you visit Kick.com
- **No More Manual Selection**: Never waste time clicking through quality menus again
- **Fixes Kick Quality Reset**: Solves the persistent issue of Kick resetting quality to Auto
- **Quality Persistence**: Your 720p, 1080p, or any quality choice stays saved
